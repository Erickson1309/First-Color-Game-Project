# First-Color-Game-Project
Only two months into coding, trying to make my own version of Colt Steeles RGB game
Need to;
- Generate random background on reload
- change h1 background back to image after reset
- add hard mode by changing 6 square opacity to 50%
- making 'hard' button act like easy and medium buttons
